# Text_to_Image_Generation_Moderation
Moderator is a safety system for text-to-image diffusion models that uses context-aware policies to detect and manage harmful or sensitive prompts. It offers users options to replace, remove, or Mosaic blur such content before image generation, ensuring ethical and secure AI image creation.


Step 1:
Create a Hugging Face access token from your Hugging Face account.

Step 2:
Copy the generated token and paste it into the hf.env file in the project directory.

Step 3:
Run the entire code from the beginning. When prompted, enter the text prompt to generate the image.

Note:
If the generated image contains any harmful content, you will be presented with three options:

Replace the harmful word with another word of your choice.

Remove the harmful content entirely.

Blur or apply a mosaic effect to the harmful part of the image.

After selecting the desired option, the final image will be generated accordingly.

Thank you for using this tool! ❤️
